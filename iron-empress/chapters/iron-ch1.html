      <p>
        The tower stairs are perilously steep. Varia, cold, hungry, and every nerve on alert, climbs them slowly. What’s at the top of the stairs is the cold, calculating and ruthless Queen of the Nord. She does not like being in the same room as the Nordi queen, which is a strange opinion to have for a royal bodyguard. She misses having no opinion at all about guarding the queen.
      </p>

      <p>
        She should have left months ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        The past year on the run from the Ansellan Empire had transformed the queen into someone that Varia did not recognize. The once bright, kind young queen had slowly changed into something colder, harsher. Varia had heard the queen’s remaining soldiers muttering about a second coming of ‘the Sea-breaker’, whatever that meant.
      </p>

      <p>
        Varia reaches the top of the stairs. Not more than six feet away is an old wooden door and from beneath it gleams golden firelight. Varia can hear two women speaking inside, but their voices are too low to understand clearly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The guard beside the door is an unfamiliar man wrapped in heavy furs and a wool cloak. The blade of his halberd gleams in the orange light from the torch above his helmeted head. Varia misses talking to the other bodyguards charged with the protecting the Nordi queen; the captain Posari, his sister Simona, and the twins, Abele and Mimi. They are all long gone now. This guard barely looks at her for longer than five seconds before he turns and steps into the room behind him.
      	<p>
          “She’s here, ma’am.” </p>
        <p>
          “Let her in, Tullo.”
        </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Varia steps around the guard and enters the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nordi queen, Kasora diFarro e Sameri, sits in front of a fireplace. The white fur draped around her shoulders and her dignified posture make the wooden chair she sits on seem like a throne. Her dark hair is carefully braided back into a single plait draped over her right shoulder. What ruins the royal picture is the permanently cloudy right eye and the pink scars furrowed into the brown skin around it. Her left eye is a clear stone-gray, cold and impassive. Recalling Kasora as she was only a year ago, unsure, naive and kinder, is impossible now.
      </p>
      <p>
      <p>
        Varia kneels at Kasora’s feet and bows her head, waiting.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Varia Hirore,” Kasora’s voice is low, controlled. “I commend you for leading the raiding party last night; those supplies will help us through the rest of the winter.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Thank you, Your Majesty.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “How many Ansellans did you manage to kill?”
      </p>
      <p>“Five, Your Majesty.”</p>
      <p>
        “Excellent.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Varia, head still bowed, can imagine a smile on the queen’s face; it’s not a warm smile.
      </p>
      “Tell me something, Varia.” Kasora continues. “Is it true that the Hirore have a network that stretches worldwide? Beyond the Nord?”
      “Yes, Your Majesty.”
      “Excellent. I want you to contact this network.”
      “May I ask your majesty why?”
      </p>
      <p>
        A pause, in which Varia hears the other person move in the room. Varia does not have to lift her head and look to know it’s Corrin, the queen’s lover. A quiet girl from the mountain tribes and a non-threat. Mostly. It was months ago now, but Varia still remembers a viciously curved spearhead barely missing her nose.
      	“Look at me, Varia.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Varia lifts her head and meets that mismatched gaze of white and gray. The slender black tattoo on Kasora’s right cheek is still discernible under the scarring, more of a warning now than an ancient mark of royalty. Varia remembers Kasora’s look of shame as they fled from that disastrous battlefield; that queen had been looking for atonement after failing to protect her own country. This queen stares down at Varia as if she is determining the quality of a garden tool.
      	“I want you to find any Hirore still living and tell them to cause trouble for the Ansellans. Poison wells, cripple supply lines, ambushes, anything that will distract them. Of course, you will be given funds. I want the Hirore to know that I can still pay and pay well. And Varia?”
      	“Yes, ma’am?”
      	“Remind the Hirore of what will happen if I am not there to protect them from the Aboliti.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Varia remembers a robust priest in flowing yellow and white robes standing in the Nordi throne room. His presence was magnetic and his voice had captivated the audience. She had not forgotten that this man’s particular Sabbian faith was responsible for nearly wiping out her family barely a hundred years before.
      	“I can leave tomorrow morning, ma’am.” she says instead.
      	“Good. You will head for the port of Voltagi first and travel west along the coast, then sail across the sea to Ovesti. Then…” the queen turns, breaking eye contact. “…the map Corrin, where is it?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Corrin rises from her window seat near the back of the room and comes forward with a battered vellum map. She’s a smaller woman than Kasora, and walks as quietly as a hunter. She is a hunter, Varia quickly reminds herself, annoyed that a pretty appearance let her forget that again. Closer, Varia can see the deep shadows under Corrin’s dark eyes as she gives Kasora the map.
      	“Thank you, Corrin. Now,” Kasora hurriedly opens the map across the table, scans it and looks back at Varia. “From Ovesti you will cross the strait into Ansello, the heart of the empire itself,” Kasora traces the route with a finger, “and then through Esaro, then back to the capitol. Should you find others outside of the Hirore network, I would like you recruit them to our cause as well. I hear there are still pockets of resistance in Cajani and Esaro, possibly Ovesti as well.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yes, Your Majesty.” Varia replies “And how should I keep in contact?”
      	“There will be no contact while you are completing this mission.” Kasora says flatly. “We will be on the move in the spring and we cannot afford to give away our position. Your mission is to simply cause chaos for the Ansellans.”
      	“I understand, ma’am.” Varia replies, her heart feeling lighter with every passing moment. She wants so badly to kiss the braided leather bracelet on her left wrist, but she remains entirely still.
      	“Here,” A soft metallic clinking and Varia looks up to see Kasora holding out a canvas pouch.
      	“Open it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the heavy pouch are silver and gold coins, likely enough to pay for a royal ransom. Sitting on top of the coins is an ornate silver ring fitted with a large sapphire. Varia carefully takes out the ring and holds it up; carved into the gem’s flat face is a falcon in flight.
      	“Should any of our allies doubt your mission, show them that.” says the queen.
      	“Yes, Your Majesty.” Varia carefully places the ring back inside the pouch, rises and bows deeply.
      	“I look forward to your success, Varia. You are dismissed.”
      	Varia has to force herself to walk at a normal pace to the door. Any thought of her mission is gone. Elena stands at a balcony haloed by light and holds out her arms, beckoning.
      	Finally, she can go home.
      </p>
      <p>
        *********
      </p>
      <p>
        The door shuts behind the assassin and Corrin lets out a breath she did not know she had been holding. Kasora looks up at her, frowning.
      	“I know you do not trust her.” The queen says carefully, reaching out to touch her arm reassuringly. Corrin smiles weakly.
      	“I don’t.”
      	“I have no other option left to me.”
      	“I know.” Corrin walks back to her window seat and sits.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What is it? Tell me.” Kasora gets up from her chair to face Corrin. “Have you heard or seen anything?” Corrin meets the queen’s piercing gaze and shakes her head.
      	“She’s <em>Hirore</em>, Kasora, you know what they are.”
      	“I have never felt threatened by Varia, or any Hirore.” Kasora says simply. Corrin does not reply immediately. Of course the Nordi Royal family never felt threatened by the Hirore, they practically owned the Hirore! Everybody else is fair game if the price is right. Corrin wants to throw something at her.
      	Instead, Corrin takes the hands offered to her and kisses them.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Then I trust you.” She says, looking up into Kasora’s face. The scars and the dead clouded eye are still unfamiliar in a face she had grown up with, but its the least of her worries right now. She closes her eyes as Kasora leans down to kiss her and gives herself over to some welcome distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, Corrin finds Varia in the small room set aside for the bodyguards, a floor below Kasora’s suite in the tower. The assassin is alone, kneeling by her bedroll and sorting through a small cadre of weapons and supplies.
      	Corrin raises a hand to knock on the open door.
      	“Come in,” the assassin says without looking up.
      	“Thanks.” Corrin moves into the room, carefully stepping over the other guards’ bedrolls and belongings. She keeps a good distance between herself and Varia, just far enough out of reach. The last time she had been this close to the assassin was in her own cabin months ago. It still felt like yesterday.
      	“Well, what do you need?” Varia turns to face Corrin and sits back on her heels, her body language relaxed. Corrin wants to throw things at this woman too.
      	“I want to make sure you’re going to actually do your job. That you’re actually going to go out and recruit Hirore for us.”
      	A pause.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Really?” The assassin says, drawing out the word. Corrin is fairly sure she isn’t imagining Varia holding back laughter just now.
      	She pushes past her temper and takes a step forward.
      	“Why have you stayed so long till now anyways?”
      	“Its my duty to be here.” Varia says simply.
      	It sounds like a rehearsed line.
      	“With things how they are… you could have left at any time.”
      	She doesn’t add that there is the very real possibility Kasora will not win back her throne. No Kasora, meant no obligation for the assassin to keep.
      	“Don’t worry, I’ll be out of your pretty hair by tomorrow morning.” Varia smiles and Corrin has the distinct impression of looking at a grinning fox.
      	“So? Will you help us or will you just run away?”
      	Varia’s smile disappears as she gets to her feet in one fluid motion and pads closer to her. Her footsteps are eerily quiet.
      	“As I said before,” the assassin says quietly, “Its my duty to be here. Whatever task the queen commands me to do, I’ll do it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I-“
      	Corrin freezes as the assassin looms over her.
      	“But I don’t like being questioned about my loyalty.”
      	“And I don’t like wondering about it.” Corrin snaps back; maybe she’s suicidal after all. The assassin is very quiet and so still. She notices, too late, that her own hand has drifted to the hunting knife at her hip. Varia just watches her, her green eyes unreadable.
      	The long pause crawls by.
      	The assassin slowly smiles.
      	“I guess we’ll have to agree to disagree.”
      	It’s not like I could seriously threaten her, Corrin thinks.
      	Varia steps back. “Excuse me, got packing to do.”
      	“O-of course.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Corrin leaves the room calmly, trying not to just break and run like her entire body wants to. At the end of the hall, she starts to tremble and when she steps into the stairwell, she has to sit down on the bottom step. Tears build behind her eyes. Varia was not going to help them, she was sure of it, and there was nothing she could do to change that. Eventually, Kasora would be captured by the Ansellans and be executed by their emperor. It was the logical demise for a monarch on the run in her own country from a much stronger invading force. A monarch who had no allies to speak of was dead in the water. Besides for all anyone outside of North Keep knew, the Nordi queen was dead. It wasn’t a surprise to Corrin that, so far, none of the Nordi barons had come out in support of Kasora. Kasora had been truthful about this plan of gathering Hirore and other rebels to her cause; it probably was her last resort.
      </p>
      <p>
        She presses her palms to her wet eyes and breathes in deeply, then out.
      	A few minutes later, she climbs the remaining stairs, dry-eyed and steady.
      	In the tower room, Kasora sits studying the map still spread out on the table. On her left is a ceramic jug of wine and her free hand idly holds a tin cup. The other hand presses flat against the map, smoothing out the miles lost and left to gain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Corrin comes close enough to lean over Kasora’s shoulder. Maybe there are escape routes marked on that map too. Corrin knows that this assumption is her own invention born of fear, lack of sleep and decent food, but it gnaws at her regardless.
      	Kasora turns slightly and reaches up to touch her cheek, a peculiar expression on her scarred face. “I have been considering something.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “What is it?”
      	“You will not like it.”
      	“Tell me. Please.”
      	Kasora sits back her seat, turns her face away slightly.
      	“I do not want you to come with me.”
      	Corrin steps back abruptly.
      	“What are you <em>talking</em> about?”
      </p>
      <p>
        Kasora turns back to face Corrin, her face anguished.
      	“If something happens to me, I will not be able to protect you.”
      	Corrin, caught between shock, insult and wanting to protest, says nothing. What exactly the Ansellan emperor might do to the secret lover of the Nordi queen is something Corrin does not want to think about.
      	Was she even that important?
      	“Corrin…” Kasora gets up. “I truly want you to come with me with all my heart, but…” Corrin lets the queen take her hands. “If everything fails, I can only think of the worst happening to those I love. Camar is…unpredictable in temperament.”
      	Corrin feels a slight shudder through their clasped hands.
      	She takes a deep breath.
      	“Kasora, I will be coming with you and there’s nothing you can do to stop me.”
      </p>
      <p>
        <p>
          “But—“
        </p>
      	“If you are captured, then I will leave.” Corrin stares back up at the queen. “No Ansellan knows about me and none will ever find me.”
      	Kasora gathers Corrin in her arms, bending slightly to press her face against her shoulder. Corrin hears Kasora breathe shakily by her ear and tightens her arms around the queen.
      	“Thank you,” Kasora murmurs “I am sorry…I did not actually want to-“
      	“I know,” Corrin says soothingly “I know.”
      	Later that night, Corrin can’t help picturing Kasora kneeling with her neck stretched out over a block. Above her is Camar, that gloriously terrible golden prince, with an axe that swings down, down, down.
